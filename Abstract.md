# ML_project: Grouping of Non-Daily Trains into Daily Trains

Golden Quadrilateral route accounts for more than
70% of traffic on the Indian railway, so itâ€™s important to use
this network efficiently. In this project, we are considering two
routes of a Quadrilateral network viz MMCT-NDLS and MAS-NDLS. We used class-based implementation with Train class
having different attributes such as arrival time, departure time,
station visited, etc. K Means Clustering algorithm was chosen to
cluster train into groups with similar property. We compared this
cluster to find a maximum dailyzing schedule. Dialyzing term will
often be used in this report which means to convert a nondaily
train running in a certain path to a daily or near-daily train
with similar coverage in terms of the path covered. Clustering
results produced can help the Indian railway to make the right
decision on adding or removing certain trains in a route. This
decision can help them to optimize their profit and people can
also get an efficient service with less overall delay
